1. **Game Interface:**
   - Created a centralized game interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Designed the interface to include a game area where the math question and stickman character are displayed, an input area for the user's answer, and a number pad for inputting numbers.
   - Styled the interface with a sky blue background and green grass, giving it a visually appealing look.

2. **Game Logic:**
   - Implemented the game logic using JavaScript.
   - Generated random arithmetic questions for the user to answer.
   - Implemented user input validation and feedback mechanisms for correct and incorrect answers.
   - Incorporated a timer for each question and for the entire game session, adding a sense of urgency and challenge.

3. **Stickman Animation:**
   - Animated the stickman character to move randomly within the game area using JavaScript.
   - Ensured the stickman stays within the boundaries of the game area, adding an element of unpredictability to the game.

4. **Sound Effects:**
   - Integrated sound effects (ding and buzz) using HTML `<audio>` elements and JavaScript.
   - Played the ding sound when the user answers a question correctly, providing positive reinforcement.
   - Played the buzz sound when the user answers a question incorrectly and when the game ends, adding interactivity and feedback to the game.

5. **User Experience Enhancements:**
   - Improved the user experience by removing the submit button and enabling the user to submit their answer by pressing the Enter key.
   - Enhanced the appearance of the number pad to resemble a dial phone, making it intuitive and easy to use.

Overall, these changes have transformed the Math Quiz Game into an engaging and interactive experience that challenges users to test their math skills while enjoying dynamic visuals and sound effects.
